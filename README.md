OpenSphericalCamera Client
=

A Python library for interfacing with cameras that implement the [OpenSphericalCamera](https://developers.google.com/streetview/open-spherical-camera/) API

Supported Cameras
-

- [Ricoh Theta S](https://developers.theta360.com/en/)
- Untested OSC cameras
	- [BublCam](http://www.bublcam.com/)
	- [Panono](https://www.panono.com/home)

Usage
-

Usage of the pure OSC API

```python
from osc.osc import *

# Initializing the class starts a session
camera = OpenSphericalCamera()
camera.state()
camera.info()

# Only need to call this if there was a problem
# when 'camera' was created
camera.startSession()

# Capture image
response = camera.takePicture()

# Wait for the stitching to finish
camera.waitForProcessing(response['id'])

# Copy image to computer
camera.getLatestImage()

# Close the session
camera.closeSession()
```

Usage of the Ricoh Theta S extended API

```python
from osc.theta import RicohThetaS

thetas = RicohThetaS()
thetas.state()
thetas.info()

# Capture image
thetas.setCaptureMode( 'image' )
response = thetas.takePicture()

# Wait for the stitching to finish
thetas.waitForProcessing(response['id'])

# Copy image to computer
thetas.getLatestImage()

# Stream the livePreview video to disk
# for 3 seconds
thetas.getLivePreview(timeLimitSeconds=3)

# Capture video
thetas.setCaptureMode( '_video' )
thetas.startCapture()
thetas.stopCapture()

# Copy video to computer
thetas.getLatestVideo()

# Close the session
thetas.closeSession()
```

Notes
-
The BublOscClient.js client is the only documentation I can find for the Bublcam custom commands. The client was not tested with actual hardware.

Requirements
-
The Python [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library is used to manage all calls to the OSC API.

Install requests with pip:
```
pip install requests
```
